PCANE: Preserving context attributes for network embedding

It is the code of the paper "PCANE: Preserving context attributes for network embedding" in PAKDD2019.
Compare to previous works, the method can preserve the attributes of not only the represented node, but also the nearby nodes.

To run the code, first unzip "data.zip" to "data" directory. Then run "PCANE++.py", the default parameter settings should work.
For PCANE refered in the paper, just set the dimension of attribute to 0: "--dim_attr=0"

The code depend on tensorflow 1.3.0 or higher version.
If you have any question about the work, feel free to contact me.
